  Since Saturday Oct 5th, I have been working to familiarize my self with the terminology to complete this technical project.  It was information overload at first, I am unfamiliar
  with what a REST Api is and how the different files in take home project work together.  After some research reading Node documentation, and Express documentation as well as a few 
  youtube videos, I have a better understanding of what I am trying to build.  Right now the goal is to begin building the back end of the application.  I am not familiar wtih JS so 
  stack overflow is going to be my friend.

 I have a good understanding of how the .js, and .json files communicate.
 I am going to create the functions I need without using mongoDB at first.
 Once Functions work I will try and implement Mongo.  I will be testing using postman.
 
 Realized that I need some form of a DB to make the functions go somewhere so I have been working on establishing a connection between mongo and the server.  The docker-compose up is not working even after using the given files. I do have docker installed.  So I have been trying to find other ways to use mongo.  The online version stopped allowing account creations in 2019 so I was unable to use that.  And I tried to install Mongo locally on my computer and it is not downloading properlly. However, I am glad that I got the server to work!
 
 In the meantime I am going to just create a DB like Emily demoed in the SEC meeting last night.
 
 I have been going at it for about 4 hours now.  The server was connected fine. Then when I added routers like we did in the SEC demo it stopped working for some reason. I tried trouble shooting this by moving the get and post into the index.js file. Still did not work for somereason.
 Which most likely means there is something wrong with the function. I am going to stop for now.  What I will do the next time is try to figure it out and see if I can get it to work.  If not I will write a commented out version of the CRUD functions that would work with mongo if it was connected. I will also try to see if I can connect mongo correctly again.

  I did not get a chance to work on it the last two days due to personal events that happened unexpectidly.  However I spent some time trying to trouble shoot some more without any luck.
  That being said I created an example.txt in the src folder that has a schema that could be used for MongoDB as well as some calls that could be used to load GET and POST information.  I am confident in what I wrote in the example.txt file and believe it would work alongside a working connection to a mongo database.
