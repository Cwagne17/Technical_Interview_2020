  Since Saturday Oct 5th, I have been working to familiarize my self with the terminology to complete this technical project.  It was information overload at first, I am unfamiliar
  with what a REST Api is and how the different files in take home project work together.  After some research reading Node documentation, and Express documentation as well as a few 
  youtube videos, I have a better understanding of what I am trying to build.  Right now the goal is to begin building the back end of the application.  I am not familiar wtih JS so 
  stack overflow is going to be my friend.
